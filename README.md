# Static rTorrent Binaries

This repository provides fully static rTorrent binaries built from the original source code of [rakshasa/rtorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent).

The goal is to provide portable Linux binaries that can run on most distributions without manually compiling rTorrent or installing runtime library dependencies.

## Why Static Binaries?

A fully static binary includes the required libraries inside the executable itself.

This makes it useful for:

- Minimal Linux systems
- Containers
- NAS/server environments
- Older distributions
- Systems where compiling from source is inconvenient
- Deployments where you want a single portable executable

## Supported Platforms

Prebuilt binaries are provided for:

- `amd64`
- `arm64`

## Binary Variants

Each release may include multiple rTorrent variants.

| Variant | Description |
|---|---|
| `rtorrent-linux-amd64` / `rtorrent-linux-arm64` | Default modern rTorrent build with JSON-RPC support |
| `*-xmlrpc-c` | Built with `xmlrpc-c` for compatibility with older XML-RPC based setups |
| `*-xmlrpc-tinyxml2` | Built with rTorrent's tinyxml2 XML-RPC support, providing a smaller XML implementation |

Use the default binary unless you specifically need XML-RPC compatibility.

## Installation

1. Download the binary for your architecture and preferred variant from the latest release.

2. Make it executable:

```sh
chmod +x rtorrent-linux-*
```

3. Optionally, move it into your PATH with the simplified filename rtorrent:
```sh
sudo mv rtorrent-linux-* /usr/local/bin/rtorrent
```

4. Verify it works:
```sh
rtorrent -h
```

## Notes
These binaries are built directly from upstream rTorrent release sources.

This repository does NOT modify rTorrent functionality. It only automates the build process and publishes static Linux binaries.
